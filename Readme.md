# Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)

## Overview
We are working on discovering causality and forming causal graphs related to Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using Markov property, acyclicity, and other such properties. After forming causal graphs, we will use Graph Attention Network (GAT) or Graph LSTM to capture temporal space and perform causal inference to check the effect of causality on our final class.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is created using ChatGPT and includes parameters discussed with doctors and medical students. This collaborative approach ensures that the data is comprehensive and clinically relevant.

## Timelines

### April - May
- **Data Set Preparation**
  - Consult with doctors and medical students to gather relevant parameters.
  - Review research papers for ideas and insights into current work.
  - Discuss with guides and experts in the research field to establish a clear path.

### May - June
- **Initial Model Development**
  - Process and clean the collected data.
  - Develop simple classification models as a baseline.
  - Validate the approach using insights from IEEE, Taylor and Francis, and Springer papers.

## Future Scope

### Forming Causal Graphs
- Using Markov property, acyclicity, and other properties to form causal graphs.
- Capturing temporal space using Graph Attention Network (GAT) or Graph LSTM.
- Performing causal inference to understand the impact on our final class.

### Dimensionality Reduction and Training
- After discovering causality, reduce the dimensionality of our dataset accordingly.
- Train a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to better capture the instances.
- Utilize principles of Explainable AI to identify the reasoning behind the model's conclusions.

### Causal Inference and Temporal Graphs
- Formulate predictions not only on whether a person is autistic but also work towards potential treatments.
- Make the deep learning network robust to incorporate other mental or physical health issues, enabling fine-tuning.

### Reinforcement Learning Framework
- Incorporate the model into a reinforcement learning framework to improve performance based on feedback.

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Causal Graphs**: Develop and validate causal graphs illustrating relationships affecting ASD diagnosis and treatment.
2. **Enhanced Predictive Models**: Create advanced predictive models using GNN and Graph LSTM for improved ASD diagnosis accuracy.
3. **Explainable AI**: Provide interpretable reasons for model predictions.
4. **Robust Model**: Develop a model that is robust and adaptable to other health issues.
